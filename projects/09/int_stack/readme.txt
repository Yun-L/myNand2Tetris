A Jack implementation of an interactive integer stack

Usage:

- First the program will initialize and show an empty stack.
- User can enter one of three options:
  - a non-negative integer: to push onto the stack
  - -1: to pop the item from the top of the stack
  - -2: to peek at the item from the top of the stack
  - -3: to end the program

- there will be a "Last Seen" field representing the last integer the user popped or peeked.
  It will be -1 when the user tries to pop or peek on an empty stack
